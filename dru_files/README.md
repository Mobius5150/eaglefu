# DRU Files
This is a collection of DRU files for manufacturers I've dealt with. While I can't neccesarily say that they are all 100% correct, it's a good start if you can't find the source.

Sources for these files are below:

 - [`DirtyPcbs/dirt_cheap_dirty_boards.v1.dru`]()
 - [`OSH Park/OSH Park.dru`](https://oshpark.com/LaenPCBOrder.dru)
 - [`Seeed Studio/2 Layer`](http://www.seeedstudio.com/document/rar/Seeed_Gerber_Generater_2-layer.zip)
 - [`Seeed Studio/4 Layer`](http://www.seeedstudio.com/document/rar/Seeed_Gerber_Generater_4-layer_1-2-15-16.rar)

Files not in the above list are likely made by me for the manufacturer in question.
